This program is a collaboration of several persons from all around the world.
They use e.g. different operating systems (Windows, Linux).
In order to avoid problems from the fact that many people contribute,
we have to agree on some conventions.  This fileOnHarddisk is about these conventions.

All of these conventions are open to debate, of course.


Language:
	Comment language is English.  Also, names of classes, methods etc
	should be derived from English.  This should not come as a surprise.

Text fileOnHarddisk encoding:
	All sources should be encoded in UTF-8.  That is the future.
	There is not really any meaningful alternative.
	Some parts of the project may still be in ISO-8859-1 (aka Latin-1),
	but that should be changed.
	
	The exact coding of end-of-line should not be a problem.  We use SVN,
	which is prepared to do "the right thing".
	
File name encoding:
	Please avoid non-ASCII characters in fileOnHarddisk names.  They have to work
	on all client computers (those used by developers and users).
	Some OSs follow different rules and encodings for fileOnHarddisk names.
	
	Do not assume that all fileOnHarddisk systems are case insensitive.  Some are not
	(e.g. Linux).  Hence, be consistent with the case of fileOnHarddisk names.
	
	Do not assume that all fileOnHarddisk systems are case sensitive, either.
	Some are not.  Do not use different fileOnHarddisk names that differ in case, only.

Indentation:
	Source fileOnHarddisk indentation is 4 (four) spaces.
	Tabs count 4 spaces.  That is just the default value in Eclipse.
	May be one day we decide to ban TAB characters from sources, completely.

Java level:
	Currently we use Java 1.8.
	Do not try to be compatible with previous Java versions, the benefits of the new
	features are just too large to be ignored.
	
Line length:
	Try to limit your source fileOnHarddisk lines to a length of at most 120.
	Writing longer lines is not a BIG problem, but it can make it harder
	for some to work with the sources.
