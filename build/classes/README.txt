What kind of text should be put into this folder?
=================================================
The idea is to put here all those texts, for which there is no better place.
The texts here are not of direct interest to the user, and are also not
part of the "product".  They are also not a direct part of the sources,
but they accompany the sources.  Examples are:
- Links to algorithms, other software or theory
- Organizational information like style guides
- Information about tools for the development like hints to use eclipse
- Ideas, plans and sketches of the software
- Conventions, terms and names

What places are there to put texts and/or documentation?
========================================================

--> User help / documentation
	What is of direct interest to the user of the software, should be part of
	the user documentation.

--> Program sources
	Documentation for which there is a good location inside the java sources,
	should be placed there, as a comment.

--> Sourceforge bug tracker
	Known bugs (and also feature requests) can be put into the sourceforge
	bug tracker.

--> Sourceforge wiki
	Currently we do not use this wiki (it is not activated).
	It could contain documentation and discussion among developers of JSoko.

--> Sokobano wiki
	This wiki is not restricted to "JSoko", it contains information about
	other Sokoban programs, too.  But it is a good place where users and
	potential future developers can be informed about plans and sub-projects.

--> Development folder (this folder)
	It shall contain what has has no better place in the above locations.
	It shall be part of the source distribution, and is maintained with the
	same source control system as the java sources.
