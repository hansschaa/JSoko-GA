This is the folder "development/Tasks" from "JSoko".
The intention is to collect text files in this folder, which correspond to
some "task" that is or could be part of the development of the program.

At the time such a task description file is created, the task itself may
still be vague.  It need not be decided to be done.

Here is the correct place to
- document ideas, proposals, feature requests and implementation ideas
- develop theory
- collect references that may help
- write rationales

As long, as you do not yet know, how the code for it will look like,
you cannot document your ideas in comments of that code (it is not yet there).
Then express yourself here.

Others may find it a worthwhile reading, and may have something to contribute.
